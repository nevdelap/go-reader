# 語 Reader — Architecture

A single-file static Japanese reader. No server, no build step — deploys anywhere (currently GitHub Pages).

## Libraries

- **[kuromoji.js](https://github.com/takuyaa/kuromoji.js)** — Pure JavaScript
  Japanese morphological analyzer. Loads binary dictionary files from `dict/` at
  startup, then tokenizes text entirely in-browser.
- **[JMdict](https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html)** — Japanese-English
  dictionary from EDRDG, bundled as a compact gzipped JSON lookup table.
- **[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)** — ISC-licensed icon set. The sun and moon
  icons are inlined as SVG in `index.html` for the theme toggle; no external
  dependency.

______________________________________________________________________

## Analytics

Google Analytics (gtag.js, ID `G-G7TXQ86GYJ`) is used for page view tracking.
The script is loaded conditionally — skipped entirely when `navigator.doNotTrack === "1"` or `window.doNotTrack === "1"`.

## Data Flow

```text
User pastes text
       │
       ▼  (300ms debounce)
stripNonJapanese()          — strips Latin, numbers, and non-Japanese punctuation
       │
       ▼
kuromoji.tokenize()         — produces morpheme tokens:
                              surface_form, reading, basic_form, pos
       │
       ▼
renderTokens()              — builds clickable <span> elements (display: inline)
                              content morphemes: foreground color
                              grammar/particles: muted color
       │
       ▼  (tap or click)
openPanel()                 — bottom panel shows:
                              • surface form + hiragana reading
                              • part of speech (mapped JP → EN)
                              • English gloss(es) from JMdict (up to two results, joined with ;)
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Dictionary Build

The full JMdict JSON is ~50 MB — too large to load in a browser.
`scripts/compact_jmdict.py` reduces it to a flat map containing only what the
app needs:

```json
{ "word": {"p": ["n", ...], "g": [["gloss1", "gloss2", ...], ...]}, ... }
```

- Only the first sense that has English glosses is used — secondary senses are
  discarded
- All English glosses from that sense are kept
- `g` is a list of gloss groups — one inner list per JMdict entry; groups are
  displayed joined with `,` within a group and `;` between groups
- On key collision (multiple entries share the same kanji/kana form), the common
  entry wins over an uncommon entry; entries of equal priority are merged
  (glosses appended as a new group, POS tags combined)
- Output: `dict/jmdict-compact.json.gz` (~7.1 MB gzipped)

To regenerate, see [Maintaining the
repository](../README.md#maintaining-the-repository) in the README.

______________________________________________________________________

## Dictionary Loading

At startup, kuromoji and JMdict are loaded in parallel. The browser decompresses
`dict/jmdict-compact.json.gz` using the native `DecompressionStream` API (falls back
to server-decompressed response when a local dev server handles gzip
automatically).

Up to 5 retry attempts with increasing delays (2s, 4s, 6s…) if either load
fails.

The dictionary URL includes a `?v=N` cache-bust parameter; increment `N` after
each rebuild to force clients past the browser cache.

______________________________________________________________________

## Lookup Logic

When a token is tapped or clicked, `lookupWord(surface_form, basic_form)` tries:

1. `basic_form` — the dictionary/base form (e.g. `食べる`), skipped if it equals
   `surface_form` or `*`
2. `surface_form` — the exact text as it appears (e.g. `食べました`)
3. **Godan imperative fallback** — if both lookups fail and the surface form
   ends in an -e row kana (え, け, げ, せ, て, ね, べ, め, れ), the final kana
   is replaced with its -u row equivalent to derive the dictionary form (e.g.
   `払え` → `払う`). This corrects a kuromoji misanalysis where godan imperatives
   are tagged as potential-form verbs (e.g. `払え` gets `basic_form: 払える`),
   whose potential form is not in the compact dictionary.

Both results from steps 1–2 are returned when found, joined with a semicolon and
space. This handles conjugated verbs and adjectives, and surfaces homograph
disambiguation (e.g. `ある` returns both the verb and the existential senses).
If neither is found in JMdict, the display falls back to the `basic_form` string
from kuromoji.

Katakana readings from kuromoji are converted to hiragana for display
(`toHiragana()`).

### Particle and Auxiliary Verb Glosses (`pg` field)

Words that function as particles or auxiliary verbs often have a primary JMdict
entry that describes their non-grammatical meaning (e.g., て as a quoting
particle,って). To ensure correct glosses in grammar contexts, the compact
dictionary includes a `pg` field containing glosses from grammar-related senses:

- **Source senses**: JMdict entries tagged as particle (`prt`), expression
  (`exp`), or auxiliary (`aux`, `aux-v`, `aux-adj`)
- **Usage**: `lookupParticle()` returns `pg` for grammar tokens; falls back to
  `g[0]` (first gloss group) if `pg` is absent

### Competing Senses (`pg2` field)

Some particles have multiple common senses where neither is clearly "primary."
For て and で:

- The **common** JMdict entry describes the quoting sense (って)
- The **conjunctive** sense (and/then, as in 食べて) is in a separate entry

Both are needed in context. The dictionary stores the conjunctive glosses in
`pg2`, and `lookupParticle()` selects between them based on kuromoji's
`pos_detail_1`:

```javascript
if (token.pos_detail_1 === '接続助詞' && entry.pg2) {
    return entry.pg2.slice(0, 3).join(', ');
}
```

This is currently the only case requiring `pg2`; other particles use `pg`
directly.

### Grammar POS Sets

Two separate sets define "grammar" for different purposes:

| Location            | Set                                         | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `compact_jmdict.py` | `{'prt', 'exp', 'aux', 'aux-v', 'aux-adj'}` | Selects which JMdict senses go into `pg` |
| `index.html`        | `['助詞', '助動詞', '記号', ...]`           | Determines which tokens get gray styling |

These map between different tag systems (JMdict English tags vs kuromoji
Japanese tags) and are not duplicated — they serve different roles in the
pipeline.

## UI Details

- **Token rendering** — tokens use `display: inline` so letter-spacing and glyph
  metrics behave consistently with the textarea input
- **Token area rebuild** — on re-tokenization, the token area DOM node is
  replaced with a clone to avoid accumulating event listeners
- **Panel height tracking** — a `ResizeObserver` keeps `--panel-height` in sync
  so the token area scrolls far enough to keep the active token visible above
  the bottom panel
- **Input buttons** — "CLEAR" clears the textarea, "CLEAR AND PASTE" clears the
  textarea then reads from the clipboard (falls back to an error message on
  permission denial), "Copy URL" / "Share" encodes the current input as a
  compressed URL fragment and copies it to the clipboard (or invokes the native
  share sheet on touch devices), "Example" loads a sample text; all return focus
  to the textarea
- **Help button** — a "?" button in the header reopens the welcome overlay
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — see dedicated section below
- **Input deduplication** — if the raw input hasn't changed since last
  tokenization, rendering is skipped
- **Debounce** — 300ms after last keypress before `analyze()` fires
- **Grammar classification** — particles (`助詞`), auxiliary verbs (`助動詞`),
  symbols, punctuation, whitespace, and filler (`フィラー`) tokens are styled
  gray and show their POS label rather than a dictionary lookup
- **Vertical reading mode** — a toggle button in the legend bar switches the
  token area between horizontal (default) and `writing-mode: vertical-rl`
  (top-to-bottom, right-to-left columns). The button label reflects the action
  to take: "Read top to bottom" when horizontal, "Read left to right" when
  vertical. On entering vertical mode the scroll position is snapped to
  `scrollLeft = scrollWidth` so the first column (rightmost) is visible
  immediately.
- **Light/dark theme** — a toggle button in the header switches between light
  (default) and dark themes using CSS custom properties on `:root`. An inline
  `<script>` in `<head>` applies the saved theme before first paint to avoid a
  flash.
- **Dim grammar toggle** — a toggle button in the legend bar switches between
  dimmed grammar tokens (default, `--text-grammar` color) and uniform coloring.
  The button label reflects the current state: "Dim grammar" / "Undim grammar".
  Preference is stored in `localStorage` (`dimGrammar`).
- **Persistence** — theme choice, reading direction, dim-grammar preference,
  welcome overlay dismissal, raw textarea input, and the selected morpheme are
  all stored in `localStorage` and restored on load. The selected morpheme is
  tied to the raw textarea value and cleared as soon as the textarea is edited.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+K` | Clear the textarea                            |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from clipboard (Clear and paste button) |
| `Alt+D`  | Toggle reading direction                      |
| `Escape` | Close welcome overlay or word details panel   |
| `?`      | Open help (welcome overlay)                   |

Shortcuts are blocked when focus is in the textarea (except Ctrl+V, which is
handled natively).

______________________________________________________________________

## Welcome Overlay

A modal dialog shown on first visit to introduce the app to new users:

- **Auto-show** — Appears 500ms after page load on first visit
- **Dismiss options**:
  - "GOT IT" button closes for this session
  - "Don't show again" checkbox saves preference to `localStorage` and prevents
    auto-show on future visits
- **Help button** — The "?" button in the header reopens the overlay at any time
- **Focus management** — When opening, focus moves to the "GOT IT" button; when
  closing, focus returns to the triggering element
- **Escape key** — Closes the overlay
- **Click outside** — Clicking the backdrop (dark area outside the dialog)
  closes the overlay
- **Persistence** — `localStorage.getItem('welcomeDismissed')` tracks whether
  the user has chosen to hide the overlay

The overlay content explains that the app is for advanced learners, that it uses
local dictionary lookups (no AI), and covers basic usage (tap or click
morphemes, grammar dimming toggle, keyboard shortcuts, browser-local
processing).

______________________________________________________________________

## URL Sharing

The "Copy URL" / "Share" button encodes the textarea content into the URL
fragment (`#t=<encoded>`):

1. The text is UTF-8 encoded and compressed with
   `CompressionStream('deflate-raw')`.
2. The compressed bytes are base64-encoded using URL-safe characters (`-` for
   `+`, `_` for `/`, no `=` padding).
3. The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard or passed to `navigator.share()`
   on touch devices.

On load (and on `hashchange`), `loadFromHash()` reverses the process — URL-safe
base64 → `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` → UTF-8 text — and populates the
textarea.

______________________________________________________________________

## Deployment

The app is fully static — serve `index.html` and the supporting files from any
static host. Fonts are vendored in `fonts/`. On first load, the browser fetches
`dict/jmdict-compact.json.gz`, the local font files, and the kuromoji binary
dictionary files in `dict/`.
